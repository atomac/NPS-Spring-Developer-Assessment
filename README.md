# NPS-Spring-Developer-Assessment
This project is for the NPS Spring Developer Assessment.

Development strategy was to expand the functionality in the WorkflowRepo and WorkflowService in order to identify CRUD functionality and realise these methods 
as concrete.

Adjustments were made to the pom.xml to realise other potential APIs required for RESTfule services.

Attempt was made to satify the tests for "SetupTests" and "TestsController" and NOT "GeneralTest" and NOT "ControllerTests".

Intially development went well, then in attempting to standardizing the presentation, using NameQueries etc, some issues resulted that could not be recovered,
even with code reversion, and some time was spent on recovery.
